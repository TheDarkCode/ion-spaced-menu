Inspired by SpacedOut.\r\n\r\n[![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/l/doctrine/orm.svg)](https://github.com/TheDarkCode/ion-spaced-menu/blob/master/LICENSE)\r\n\r\n###Usage:\r\n\r\nInclude the ion-spaced-menu.css file in the header after all other ionic css files. Include ion-spaced-menu in footer with other javascript being loaded.\r\n\r\nIn your main app module, you need to add \"ion-spaced-menu\" to your app's dependencies.\r\n\r\nModify CSS as necessary to your liking. Currently set to left: 40px, with 90% height, and 5% top/bottom margins.\r\n\r\nIt is recommended that you use drag-content=\"false\" on ion-side-menus and ion-side-menu-content. Otherwise you can crash your app from trying to swipe too much on some platforms (not in browsers).\r\n\r\nMenu-right will work like a normal right side menu and get tagged as inactive (modify with css to liking if you want to show it on wide-format displays).\r\n\r\n####ionic-ion-airbnbmenu repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/mAmged/ionic-ion-airbnbmenu\r\n\r\n####SpacedOut repo:\r\nhttps://github.com/ace-subido/spaced-out\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
